------------------------------------------------File handling--------------------------------
It is a way of processing a file such as creating a new file, reading content in a file, writing content to a file, appending content to a file, renaming the file and deleting the file


 # Class File:

 --   Inherits from class IO, in particular, methods for creating, reading, and writing files
 --   Includes module FileTest. which provides dozens of additional methods.
   
# Common modes for File Handling

	“r” : Read-only mode for a file.
	“w” : Write-only mode for a file.
	“a” : Write-only mode, if file exists it will append the data otherwise a new file will be created.
	“r+” : Read-Write mode for a file.
	“w+” : Read-Write mode for a file.
	“a+” : Read and Write mode, if file exists it will append the data otherwise a new file will be created.


-----------------------------------------Creating methods ---------------------------------------------------

 1) file.new() -  create a new File using File.new() method for reading, writing or for both, according to the mode string. we can use 					  fileobject.close() method to close that file.
 
There are two methods to open a file in Ruby:

----- File.new method : Using this method a new file can be created for reading, writing or both.
      3.0.0 :020 > fileobj = File.new('sample.txt', 'w+')
 => #<File:sample.txt> 

----  File.open method : Using this method a new file object is created. That file object is assigned to a file. 

	  3.0.0 :022 > File.open('sample.txt', 'w+') do |file|
      3.0.0 :023 > end


Difference between both the methods is that File.open method can be associated with a block while File.new method can't.
			   
						   
2) link(old_name, new_name) → 0 - Creates a new name for an existing file using a hard link. Will not overwrite new_name if it already 									  exists (raising a subclass of SystemCallError).

	3.0.0 :024 > File.link('sample.txt', 'sample1.txt')   # a new file created 
 	=> 0 

3)  mkfifo(file_name, mode=0666) => 0   (create pipe file)
	Creates a FIFO special file with name file_name. mode specifies the FIFO's permissions. It is modified by the process's umask in the 	 usual way: the permissions of the created file are (mode & ~umask).
	
	3.0.0 :028 > File.mkfifo('sample3.txt', mode=0666)
 	=> 0

4)  symlink() → Creates a symbolic link for the given file path. 
	symlink(old_name, new_name) → 0
	
	(a symbolic link is a term for any file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution.)
	
	

-------------------------------------------Querying Methods ---------------------------------------------
Paths --- 

1) ::absolute_path() -- Returns the absolute file path for the given path.

absolute_path(file_name [, dir_string] ) → abs_file_name- Converts a pathname to an absolute pathname. Relative paths are referenced from the current working directory of the process unless dir_string is given, in which case it will be used as the starting point. If the given pathname starts with a “~'' it is NOT expanded, it is treated as a normal directory name.

  3.0.0 :031 > File.absolute_path('sample.txt')
  => "/home/beryl/sample.txt" 
  
2)  absolute_path?(file_name) → true or false - Returns true if file_name is an absolute path, and false otherwise.
	
	3.0.0 :032?> File.absolute_path? ('sample.txt')
	 => false 
	3.0.0 :033 > File.absolute_path? ('/home/beryl/sample.txt')
	 => true 

3) ::basename - Returns the last component of the given file path.

---- basename(file_name [, suffix] ) → base_name  
	  3.0.0 :034 > File.basename("/home/beryl/sample.txt")
 		=> "sample.txt" 
 		
 	  3.0.0 :036 > File.basename("/home/beryl/sample.txt", ".txt")
	 => "sample" 
	3.0.0 :037 > File.basename("/home/beryl/sample.txt", ".*")
 	=> "sample" 
 	
4) ::dirname - Returns all but the last component of the given file path. 
   
--->  dirname(file_name, level = 1) → dir_name - Returns all components of the filename given in file_name except the last one (after 
                                          first stripping trailing separators)
                                          
 3.0.0 :049 > File.dirname("/home/beryl/sample.txt")
 => "/home/beryl" 
                          
5)::expand_path -  Returns the absolute file path for the given path, expanding ~ for a home directory.

--- expand_path(file_name [, dir_string] ) → abs_file_name

	3.0.0 :055 > File.expand_path("~/home")
	 => "/home/beryl/home" 
	3.0.0 :056 > File.expand_path("~")
	 => "/home/beryl" 
	3.0.0 :057 > File.expand_path("~/traning")
	 => "/home/beryl/traning" 
	3.0.0 :058 > File.expand_path("traning", "/home/beryl")
	 => "/home/beryl/traning" 

6) ::extname - Returns the file extension for the given file path.

--- extname(path) → string--Returns the extension (the portion of file name in path starting from the last period).

3.0.0 :061 > File.extname("/home/beryl/sample")
 => "" 
3.0.0 :062 > File.extname("/home/beryl/sample.txt")
 => ".txt" 

7) ::fnmatch? (aliased as ::fnmatch) --Returns whether the given file path matches the given pattern.

--- fnmatch( pattern, path, [flags] ) → (true or false)
--- fnmatch?( pattern, path, [flags] ) → (true or false)
 
	3.0.0 :064 > File.fnmatch('c?t',     'cat') 
	 => true 
	3.0.0 :065 > File.fnmatch('cat',     'cat') 
	 => true 
	3.0.0 :066 > File.fnmatch('cat',     'category') 
	 => false 
	3.0.0 :067 > File.fnmatch('c??t',     'cat') 
	 => false 
	3.0.0 :068 > File.fnmatch('c*',     'cat') 
	 => true 

8) ::join --- Joins path components into a single path string.

	3.0.0 :072 > File.join("home", "beryl", "sample.txt")
	 => "home/beryl/sample.txt" 

9) ::path -- Returns the string representation of the given path.

	3.0.0 :073 > File.path("home/beryl/sample.txt")
	 => "home/beryl/sample.txt" 

10) ::readlink - Returns the path to the file at the given symbolic link.

-- readlink(link_name) → file_name -- Returns the name of the file referenced by the given link. Not available on all platforms.

3.0.0 :077 > File.readlink("sample5.txt")
 => "sample.txt" 

11) ::realdirpath --  Returns the real path for the given file path, where the last component need not exist.

-- realdirpath(pathname [, dir_string]) → real_pathname 

Returns the real (absolute) pathname of pathname in the actual filesystem. The real pathname doesn't contain symlinks or useless dots.

If dir_string is given, it is used as a base directory for interpreting relative pathname instead of the current directory.


	3.0.0 :082 > File.realdirpath('/home/beryl/sample.txt')
 	=> "/home/beryl/sample.txt" 

12) ::split -- Returns an array of two strings: the directory name and basename of the file at the given path. 
 
--> split(file_name) → array -- Splits the given string into a directory and a file component and returns them in a two-element array

	3.0.0 :084 > File.split('/home/beryl/sample.txt')
	 => ["/home/beryl", "sample.txt"] 

13) path (aliased as to_path) --   Returns the string representation of the given path.

---- path → filename
---- to_path → filename

Returns the pathname used to create file as a string. Does not normalize the name.

The pathname may not point to the file corresponding to file. For instance, the pathname becomes void when the file has been moved or deleted.

	3.0.0 :085 > fileobj = File.new('sample.txt').path
 	=> "sample.txt"


------------------------------------------------times Method--------------------------------------------------------
1) ::atime --    Returns a Time for the most recent access to the given file.
